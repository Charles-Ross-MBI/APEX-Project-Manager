"""
Utility for uploading and displaying shapefiles in a Streamlit app.

This module lets users upload zipped shapefiles containing point or polyline geometry.
It extracts the file, reads it with GeoPandas, and displays the geometry on
an interactive Folium map inside Streamlit, with a bottom message bar showing details.
